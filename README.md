From hacking early websites in the 90s to leading engineering today, I’ve spent 20+ years building web and cloud systems that scale. I hold a BSc in Computer Science in Media (Furtwangen, DE) and an MSc in Media Technology (Leiden, NL), co‑founded several companies and communities, and ran an Estonian e‑Residency consultancy while traveling as a digital nomad through Europe and Asia. Now settled in Boulder, Colorado, I lead software at Nevados, channeling that broad journey into tools & automations for climate and clean energy impact. In my free time I soak up the Rockies with my family - hiking, mountain biking, snowboarding and camping.
